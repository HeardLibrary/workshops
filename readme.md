## Getting Started with Digital Curation ##

8 November 2016

If you're dealing with the web, you face the problem of information overload. How do you collect and organize your scholarly interests, particularly collections of images? We'll teach you how to get started with digital curation using two platforms: [Pinterest](www.pinterest.com) and [Historypin](https://www.historypin.org/). Digital curation is not just about organizing images of cats and your favorite vacation spots. By the end of this workshop, you'll know how to use these curatorial tools to advance your scholarly work.  

## What is Digital Curation?

The process--Curation--and the person--Curator--share the Latin root "curare" meaning to "take care."  Traditionally, curators manage and interpret material objects whether that's art, books, buidlings, scientific tools, or more recently, born-digital data and objects.  They are content specialists who interpret collections of objects for and, increasingly, with the public.

Digital means of, relating to, or being data in the form of especially binary digits
Digital Curation: the act of managing, storing, and interpreting a collection of objects (digitized or born digital) stored in digital formats and accessible over a network.

Both HistoryPin and Pinterest originated with a basic framework of interpretation, namely, that all users want images, ideas and interpretation that relates to their personal experience. Pinterest was started in 2009 by three engineers Evan Sharp, Ben Silbermann, and Paul Sciarra; the name refers to how collectors preserve their butterfly specimens.

## Pinterest

Using a visual bookmarking tool like Pinterest allows users to collaborate and fosters community input about digital collections. Over 100 Galleries, Libraries, Archives and Museums use Pinterest to promote discovery of their collections. [Pinterest](https://about.pinterest.com/en)'s bulk uploader and simple platform mean it's easy to learn.

Once you create a username and password, you can follow topincs you like from architecture to libraries, from Github to manuscripts. Create your profile then search for topics that interest you. [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/)'s settings allow you to know who's following your pins, who's invited you to follow their boards, and other ways to connect with users.

Topics are called boards. Within each board, you can like or "pin" it, save it or follow the owner's board.  Click on Pinterest's Browser button up in your browser to link all your web searches into Pinterest and feed boards and images to you. 

Choose an image for your pin.  Pick a board to save it to. Pinterest hones your selections and suggests boards for you to follow. You can create boards of museum collections like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or group together your favorite archaeology boards.  

Special tips on [Pinterest for Business](https://business.pinterest.com/en/getting-started/) help you organize material, link it out and create pages that stand out.  Identify [what your pinners like](https://business.pinterest.com/en/pin-pro) by checking your analytics, or better yet, ask them. This all leads to better "curation" or management of your images. Analytics, widgets, and rich pins help pinners build followers, create consistent imagery, and yes, sell products.

## [HistoryPin](http://www.historypin.org/en/) 

HistoryPinâ€™s members work together to create collections, telling the stories about their local communities and the places that matter to them. Over 25,000 collections are represented, including national culture palaces (the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, the US Archives), regional institutions with large collections ([The Library of Virginia](https://www.historypin.org/en/library-of-virginia-s-collection/geo/37.238012,-76.775108,11/bounds/37.09027,-76.923081,37.385465,-76.627136/paging/1) and California Historical Society) to specialized collections (the Dr. Pepper Museum) and individual member's collections. 

Based on Pinterest's system of boards, HistoryPin users annotate images, locate them on a map, and store them in boards. After you create your account, you can search for places, people, and other details described in the photos. Searches can be sorted by most recent, most popular and other. Searches of bulleton board forums help users talk to each other about sources, historical details and resources. FAQs address HistoryPin in the classroom, for intergenerational learning, community building, and for digital field work.

## How are digital collections used in scholarship? ##

Public institutions have pooled resources for digital projects in California, New England, the UK, and Australia. California Historical Society posts selections of their large photography collections housed at University of Southern California Digital Library], focusing on the development of the Los Angeles region from 1860 to 1960. Additional collections from other GLAM institutions (Galleries, Libraries, aRchives and Museums) allow users to explore across media.  [San Francisco, CA](https://www.historypin.org/en/explore/geo/37.77493,-122.419416,12/bounds/37.701624,-122.493402,37.848164,-122.34543/search/keyword:Washington%20St/sort/popular/paging/1/pin/16286) includes transportation images from the Municipal Transit Authority, the SF Public Library, CA Historycal Society and several others like this USGS image of [the 1906 Earthquake aftermath](https://www.historypin.org/en/explore/geo/37.77493,-122.419416,12/bounds/37.701624,-122.493402,37.848164,-122.34543/search/keyword:Washington%20St/sort/popular/paging/1/pin/16286). Besides public collections, HistoryPin's staff co-curates projects like The Year of the Bay that aggregate [resources from many instituions](https://www.historypin.org/en/explore/geo/37.77493,-122.419416,12/bounds/37.701624,-122.493402,37.848164,-122.34543/search/keyword:Washington%20St/sort/popular/paging/1) in a single spot, like this image of house moving on Washington St.

Access to distant collections makes HistoryPin a unique aggregator of maps and images.  Collections like the [Tasmanian State Library]( https://www.historypin.org/en/tastafe-libraries-s-collection/geo/-42.144553,146.822323,5/bounds/-50.329231,137.352108,-32.747417,156.292538/pin/319319) include photos, postcards and clippings files.
