<h3 id="text-mining-with-the-r-tm-package">Text Mining with the R tm Package</h3>
<h4 id="friday-january-8">Friday, January 8</h4>
<p><em>Cliff Anderson</em></p>
<ul>
<li>This workshops teaches the basics of text mining or the large-scale analysis of textual corpora. If you have interest in finding and visualizing patterns in textual corpora, this workshop will help you get started. In particlar, we’ll show you how to use the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tm/index.html">tm: Text Mining Package</a> in R.

<h3 id="annotating-the-web-with-genius-and-hypothes.is">Annotating the Web with Genius and Hypothes.is</h3>
<h4 id="friday-january-15">Friday, January 15</h4>
<p><em>Ed Warga</em></p>
<ul>
<li>A web annotation is an online annotation associated with a web resource. With a Web annotation system, a user can add, modify or remove information from a Web resource without modifying the resource itself. The annotations can be thought of as a layer on top of the existing resource, and this annotation layer is usually visible to other users who share the same annotation system. In such cases, the web annotation tool is a type of social software tool (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_annotation">Wikipedia</a>). We will explore the concept of web annotation and discuss its use in digital research. We will try out a few different tools for web annotation and evaluate their usefulness for inclusion in participants’ research workflows.</li>
