####Scenario for hands-on activity
It's time to create your own Trello board! We will each create a simple board given a specific scenario. You may work independently or in pairs -- your choice.

If you have a **real-life scenario** in mind that you would like to try out, work-related or not, please feel free to use it! If not, we give you this **sample scenario** to use for this exercise:

> The holidays have just passed. For most of us, this is a very hectic time of year, with many responsibilites and commitments. Imagine that you have been designated to host your family's holiday gathering this year. How might you use a Trello board to organize this large responsibility? Some tasks to consider (you may think of more!):
> 
> * Meal-planning
> * Gifts (buy for all, buy for kids only, draw names, Dirty Santa...?)
> * Decorating your house
> * Cleaning your house
> 
> Think about what tasks, people, and deadlines might be needed to pull off a successful family holiday gathering, and see if you can organize it all in a Trello board!

You will have about **30 minutes** to work on this, so get creative! After this hands-on time, we will share with the group how we put our boards together and what challenges, delights, or surprises we encountered during the process.
