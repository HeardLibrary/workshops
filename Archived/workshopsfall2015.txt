<p><em>Among other things, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a social network for computer programmers. But GitHub is also a fantastic educational technology. In this session, we’ll introduce you to <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>, the distributed version control system that powers GitHub. We’ll show you how to set up an account with GitHub and collaborate with others on projects. You will learn the basics of Markdown, the simple markup language used to communicate on GitHub. We’ll talk about the uses of GitHub in the classroom, the sciences, and the digital humanities. If you’re brave, we’ll even get into advance topics like branching and forking. By the end of the session, you’ll be ready to create repositories and collaborate with scholars around the interwebs.</em></p>

In this session, we’ll teach you how to analyze networks using the open source graph database <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4J</a>. We will show you how to set up a sample network, analyze the relations between its parts, and visualize the results using a simple query language called <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/learn/cypher">Cypher</a>. You’ll leave with the ability to analyze simple networks and with the tools you’ll need to develop more complex projects.</em></p>

<p><em>The concept of Linked Data encompasses a broad set of techniques, tools and query languages that allow for connecting structured data. RDF is a tool for structuring data as defined by the W3C. Once data is structured using RDF, you can query it using the query langauage SPARQL. Callimachus is a Linked Data management system. It is an open source tool that allows you to easily execute SPARQL queries on RDF data. Join us as we explore an RDF dataset to see the power of linked data and the range of questions we can now ask of this structured data.</em></p>
