# Using Tails

## The American Library Association’s Code of Ethics
We protect each library user’s right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or
received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.

## Learning Outcomes

* Articulate the issues between privacy and convenience.
* Learn what tools are available for protecting privacy.
* Be able to install Tails on personal computer.



## What is Tails?

Tails is an operating system that allows you to compute without

## Why might we want to use Tails?

* What kind of data are we creating?
* All data is being recorded. Being tracked by more entities than you suspect.
* Revenue derived from tracking. The default has changed, before the internet, no permanent centralized record was maintained. Data storage costs have plummeted so keeping data is cheaper than throwing it away.
* Info from Google is granular; although guidelines are mostly stringent, they still know a lot about us.
* FB can tell from social graph sexual orientation, Frequency of communication, breakups divorce etc.
* Data mining marketing materials (ex: for pregnant girl, purchase patterns predict pregnancy, switching from scented to unscented lotion. Patterns that with high degree of accuracy correlate.)
* Amount of info that accounts have on you, were they in the hands of the gov't would look like a Police state.
* what you are thinking about,
* medical conditions,
* politics,
* music you like,
* tracking in detail what you are doing on a page,
* scrolling speed,
* moving mouse around page,
* what you copied.
* what pages you are looking at ads coming from 3rd party sites

All of these indicators of human activity act as transmitters on page.  Data brokers then connect activity on one part of the internet with other areas.

Both Creepy and convenient at the same time

* Fit bits
* Network sensing devices
* Green energy use?
* Reccomendation engines

Data gathering is invisible. You can see using a plugin called ghost ray...entity and correlate that fact that ...megabytes of trackers that come from ...marketing email contains tracking links to unique identifier. You can shut this off but you might not know about it ...privacy features.


## Should we be alarmed?

* Companies want to make money by and large so they are not that interested in using info against you.
**Govt intelligence agencies for political activism,
Current legal doctrines, data has easy access...3rd party doctrine, established before large data mining. Can be obtained by simple subpoena. Phone bill call history must be stored for 4 years, symbiotic survillance state, partnership with major technology platforms. Bot vs. person. Govt has access to it but companies are willing and able to fight back especially if public. Will you expend time and money on expensive lawyers if it’s invisible?
By default, computer is sending some info. Fingerprinting. They should be turning over info consensually.  Too much friction if you make everyone constantly agree and functions move offshore. Balkanizing  internet. Thorny problem. Practically how do you achieve.

Companies are going to collect data, skeptical in getting govt involved ghost ---ad blocker

Govts look for encrypted trafffic …

Telegram messaging app…

Threat model..I think I’m being targeted by state

Make the stuff the default.

Signal ...if you are communicating intermittantly...always using secure technology so nothing stands out. Herd effect...govts look for encrypting to see unusual activites relative to yourself or everyone.

Constance arms race with data gathers vs.

Internet of Things….censor enabled networked computing devices. Convenient but harder to have assurance of anonymity. Reconstruct pattern of sounds . Am I aware of every censor around me.

Apple vs. FBI fight first salvo into developer keys. Have backdoor already needs to accept updates ...regulate by cryptographic keys...system of trust...keeping your software up to date may mean govt. Intrusion...sooner or later govts will start demanding access to developer keys.

Secure operating system called Tails
Starts afresh each time...new version is the same and doesn’t have spyware. Required to trust companies. Serious privacy and security protection come at cost of convenience.
