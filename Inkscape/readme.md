# Creating Infographics with Inkscape
## About Inkscape
* Inkscape is an open source vector graphics editor 
* Features robust toolset for creating/editing illustrations and graphics
* Runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux

Inkscape is used to create illustrations, diagrams, line art, charts, logos and complex images. It [pairs well](http://visualisingadvocacy.org/resources/visualisationtools) with other data visualization applications (including R, Tableux, Open Refine, Google Maps, D3.js, etc.) and provides a great degree of control for changing the appearance and layout of the data elements and combining them with other visuals to create infographics.
