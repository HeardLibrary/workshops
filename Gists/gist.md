##Workshop Description

##[Github Gists](https://gist.github.com), 

Github offers a useful service called Gist. It was first created so  that developers could share code snippets but Gists have many other practical uses as well. Gists can be used for a variety of tasks. We will learn accessible, (re)usable, and visually-appealing ways to share your data and research online. We'll explore how to create and share CSVs, GIS data points, and simple graphs using Gists.
