# Using Tails

## The American Library Association’s Code of Ethics
We protect each library user’s right to privacy and confidentiality with respect to information sought or
received and resources consulted, borrowed, acquired or transmitted.

## Learning Outcomes

* Articulate the issues between privacy and convenience.
* Learn what tools are available for protecting privacy.
* Be able to install Tails on personal computer.



## What is Tails?

Tails is an operating system that allows you to compute and still maintain privacy and anonymity. 

## Why might we want to use Tails?

* What kind of data are we creating?
* All data is being recorded. Being tracked by more entities than you suspect.
* Revenue derived from tracking. The default has changed, before the internet, no permanent centralized record was maintained. * Data storage costs have plummeted so keeping data is cheaper than throwing it away.
* Info from Google is granular; although guidelines are mostly stringent, they still know a lot about us.
* FB can tell from social graph sexual orientation, Frequency of communication, breakups divorce etc.

* Data mining marketing materials (ex: for pregnant girl, purchase patterns predict pregnancy, switching from scented to unscented lotion. Patterns that with high degree of accuracy correlate.)
* Amount of info that accounts have on you, were they in the hands of the gov't would look like a Police state.
* What you are thinking about,
* Medical conditions,
* Politics,
* Music you like,
* Books you buy. 
* Tracking in detail what you are doing on a page,
* Scrolling speed,
* Moving mouse around page,
* What you copied.
* What pages you are looking at.

All of these indicators of human activity act as transmitters on page.  Data brokers then connect activity on one part of the internet with other areas.

Both Creepy and convenient at the same time

* Fit bits
* Network sensing devices
* Green energy use
* Reccomendation engines

Data gathering is invisible. You can see using a plugin called ghost ray.

## Should we be alarmed?

* Companies want to make money by and large so they are not that interested in using info against you.
* Govt intelligence agencies for political activism

Current legal doctrines, data has easy access using the 3rd party doctrine, which was established before large data mining.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third-party_doctrine

Can be obtained by simple subpoena. Phone bill call history must be stored for 4 years, symbiotic survillance state, partnership with major technology platforms. Bot vs. person. Govt has access to it but companies are willing and able to fight back especially if public. Will you expend time and money on expensive lawyers if it’s invisible?
By default, computer is sending some info. Fingerprinting. They should be turning over info consensually.  Too much friction if you make everyone constantly agree and functions move offshore. Balkanizing  internet. Thorny problem. Practically how do you achieve?

Companies are going to collect data, do we really want the government involved in regulation?  

## Should we do something about it? 

* Step in a suite of things to protect your online privacy
* Privacy subset of security
* Level of security depends on what you are defending against

People who don’t want to be casually tracked are:

* Journalists
* Academics
* Activists
* Celebrities

The problem is, Governments look for encrypted traffic to see unusual activites relative to yourself or everyone. It's the heard effect.

One solution, make the stuff the default.

Constant arms race with data gathers vs. public interest. 

As we move into the Internet of Things we now have censor enabled networked computing devices. More convenience but increasing difficulty  to have assurance of anonymity. Reconstruct pattern of sounds. Am I aware of every censor around me? 

Apple vs. FBI fight 

The first salvo into access to developer keys. Developer keys are what software and hardware companies use to update our systems so your computer needs to have a backdoor in order to accept updates. This is regulated by cryptographic keyswhich depends on a system of trust. Apple knows this and therefore doesn't want the govt to have access to these keys as that would undermine trust. If you think that keeping your software up to date may mean gov't intrusion, you might be less inclined at best, to keep your software up to date and at worse, use it at all. Sooner or later governments will start demanding access to developer keys.

## Tails 
Secure operating system called Tails, Tails tarts fresh each time, it's a new version is the same and doesn’t have spyware. Required to trust companies. Serious privacy and security protection come at cost of convenience.
