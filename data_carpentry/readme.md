### Why use a Spreadsheet for Data Collection?




### Why not use a Spreadsheet for Data Analysis?


## What should I use for Data Analysis? 



## Structuring data in spreadsheets

* Put all your variables in columns - the thing you’re measuring, like ‘name’ 'origen' ‘form’.
* Put each observation/unit  in its own row.
* Don’t combine multiple pieces of information in one cell. (Sometimes it just seems like one thing, but think if that’s the only way you’ll want to be able to use or sort that data.
* Leave the raw data raw - don’t mess with it!

Exercise: You are collecting data on monsters, either in the field or from written sources
1) Create new spreadsheet
2) Set up the column headers you will want i.e what you will want to know about each monster such as food source, ability, description.
3) Establish 10 species you will be tracking.
4) Be sure to create some date field such as last know sighting or first documented mention. 
5) Fill in the data fields with information about the monster you are tracking. 
5) Create the same data for a different year in a separate tab.
