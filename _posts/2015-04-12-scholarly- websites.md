##Goals
![Online presence](http://www.pmcwriters.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Online-Presence-Management.jpg)

Increasingly, we all have an online presence whether we want to or not. Articles written, comments posted, online opinions expressed all float around cyberspace and are reflections of our online identity. One way to take control of the message is to create your own website. This allows you to write your own story and link out to the services and web pages that best illustrate who you are. In today's class we will learn about tools you might want to use to create your scholarly presence.
 
##Tools of the Trade

There are many ways to build a website. In this tutorial we will focus on tools that allow you to get up and running with litte or no background in web development. 

###Services you pay for
####Squarespace

Squarespace is an excellent all around platform for buiding websites. Although you pay a fee to have your site hosted, it can save you a lot of time and trouble if managing your website is not something you want to spend time on.

####Wordpress 
Wordpress started off as a blogging platform but has grown to become a widely used, lightweight, content management tool for websites as well. The advantage of hosting your own instance of Wordpress (rather than using Wordpress hosting in the cloud options) is that you have maximum flexibility to customize and take advantage of the thousands of themes developed by the Wordpress community that are either free or available for purchase.

###Services you don't pay for
There are many hosting options for personal websites that can help manage your scholarly presence. Sites like Tumblr, Blogger and Google sites are all freely available and have a wide variety of uses. Two tools that we will look at today are especially useful as they are easy to set up and manage. 

####Github Pages

Everyone who opens a free Github account can build a set of webpages under their domain.

####Wordpress

It is also possible to create a scholarly website directly on the Wordpress site.

#####Wordpress at Vanderbilt

Vanderbilt Web Communications hosts a wordpress installation with a few themes customized for the  Vanderbilt environment.  Any member of the Vanderbilt community can set up a free site using this service. I'll show you the basics of getting going and we'll create a bare bones profile page that you can then later go back and customize. Vanderbilt Web Services sponsors monthly training sessions on how to use my.vanderbilt.edu
