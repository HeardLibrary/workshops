##Hello World!

###This Is My Letter To The World

This is my letter to the world,  
That never wrote to me,--  
The simple news that Nature told,  
With tender majesty.  
Her message is committed  
To hands I cannot see;  
For love of her, sweet countrymen,  
Judge tenderly of me!  

*Emily Dickinson*
