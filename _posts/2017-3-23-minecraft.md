### Gaming in the Academy?

*Just some highlights. Feel free to submit pull requests with other key moments.*

  * [Game Studies: International Journal of Computer Game Research](http://gamestudies.org/), the "first academic, peer-reviewed journal dedicated to computer game studies," commences publication in 2001.

  *  [DiGRA](http://www.digra.org/) (Digital Games Research Association), an "association for academics and professionals who research digital games and associated phenomena," is founded in 2003.

  * Starting in 2008, the American Library Association sponsors the [International Games Day](http://igd.ala.org/) on the third Saturday every November.

  * Also in 2008, Scott Nicholson, Associate Professor at the School of Information Studies, founds the Library Game Lab at Syracuse University. He now
directs its successor, [Because Play Matters Game Lab](http://becauseplaymatters.com/)

  * In 2013, Jay Clayton, William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of English at Vanderbilt University, teaches the first MOOC on online gaming: [Online Games: Literature, New Media, and Narrative](https://www.coursera.org/course/onlinegames)


### Exploring [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/)

  * [Markus Persson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markus_Persson), a.k.a. "Notch," is the lead developer of Minecraft. [Mojang](https://mojang.com/), an independent game studio until its [acquisition by Microsoft in 2014](http://news.microsoft.com/2014/09/15/minecraft-to-join-microsoft/) launched the beta version of Minecraft in 2009 and the release version in 2011.

  * Minecraft is an [Open World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world) style game, meaning that there aren't well-defined goals or narratives. The Minecraft game environment is frequently compared to an online Lego® set.

  * Minecraft is a client/server application. While it is possible to play the game on your own machine, a lot of the fun comes from interacting with other players on Minecraft servers.
  
 * [Making Sense of Minecraft](http://education.uic.edu/academics-admissions/student-life/making-sense-minecraft)
