# Getting Started with Wikidata

This tutorial introduces the basics of [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page), an offshot of Wikipedia. Since its launch four years ago on October 30, 2012, Wikidata has developed rapidly and has become a repository of all kinds of facts across the Wikipedia language editions. In what follows, you will become familiar with the purpose and goals of Wikidata, including how to contribute to its development.

## Learning Outcomes

* Articulate the short and long term goals of Wikidata
* Learn various ways to contribute Wikidata
* Write simple SPARQL queries to retrieve data from Wikidata

## What is Wikidata?

To understand the problems that Wikidata addresses, you need to reflect on the challenges posed by Wikipedia's [295 language editions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Wikipedias). Ideally, articles in these language editions should be linked together. So, if you create an article about a Portuguese scholar on the English Wikipedia, you'd want to connect that article to any existing articles on other language editions, including the Portuguese edition but also to the Chinese, French, etc. editions too. In the past, you had to create these language links manually. As might be expected, syncronizing editions was sometimes spotty, meaning that an equivalent article might exist on another language edition, but not be reported on your edition.
