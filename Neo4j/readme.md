# Graph Databases vs. Relational Database
Not flimsy nonsense, but a web of sense.
---Vladimir Nabokov

## Learning Outcomes

* Articulate the differences between graph databases and relational difference.
* Understand the principles of mathematic graphs.
* Be able to load .csv data into Neo4j.

## What is a graph database?

A graph database is a type of NOSQL database that stores data based on a model derived from mathematical graphs. 
Mathematical graphs allow for the expression of concepts in terms of nodes and edges and because there are properties inherent
to all mathematical graphs, it is possible to use computational techniques to search for common patterns. When the nodes and edges 
of a graph are populated with data, they become networks. 

## How does it differ from a relational database?

Relational Databases store data in rows and columns and the relationships between the rows and columns are handled by "joins". 
Simplistically speaking, Graph Databases store data in the form of a graph and this allows for the ability to search for patterns in data. 

## When might I want to use one?

Graph databases are useful when you have data that is not neatly organized into rows and columns. It is also good when you 
want to create inferences based on patterns. Also when you want to be able to share data across data silos.
