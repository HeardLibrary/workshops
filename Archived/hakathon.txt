<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The HyperStudio at MIT is sponsoring a <em>Hack the Comédie Française</em> event on December 16 in Paris to celebrate the completion of <a href="http://cfregisters.org/">The Comédie Française Registers</a> Project. The HyperStudio is a Laboratory for Digital Humanities that incorporates new media technology to increase education and research. The <em>Comédie Française Registers</em> encodes data about plays, performers, and performances at the Comédie Française from 1680 to 1790.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt University Library is sponsoring a satellite hackathon (in collaboration with the Department of French and Italian) during the morning of Wednesday, December 16th. Participants will learn how to access the data from the Comédie Française Registers (including plays, actors,locations of performances, etc.) and to develop different kinds of digital humanities applications with that data.</p>
<p>All are welcome. No registration is necessary! Just bring your interest in French culture and history. Coffee and French pastries will be provided.</p>
