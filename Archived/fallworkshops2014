<h4 id="toc_13">Friday, October 17</h4>
<ul>
<li>Morgan Daniels</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The datasets underlying research findings are increasingly acknowledged as valuable scholarly products. Through data publication, researchers can give more visibility to their work while making data available to others for reuse. This workshop will address data publication from the researcher's perspective, including benefits to researchers and best practices for sharing datasets. Participants will learn how to submit a dataset to <a href="http://figshare.com/">Figshare</a>, a versatile online tool for data publication.</em></p>

We'll show you how to set up an account with GitHub and collaborate with others on projects. You will learn the basics of Markdown, the simple markup language used to communicate on GitHub. We'll talk about the uses of GitHub in the classroom, the sciences, and the digital humanities. If you're brave, we'll even get into advance topics like branching and forking. By the end of the session, you'll be ready to create repositories and collaborate with scholars around the interwebs.</em></p>

<h4 id="toc_19">Friday, November 7</h4>
<ul>
<li>Chris Benda</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Keeping track of references while doing research, and deploying those references in papers, books, and other texts, became much easier with the advent of bibliographic management systems like EndNote and RefWorks. <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, one of the more recent entrants in the field, is an open source program that works in the Firefox browser or as a standalone application. This workshop will introduce Zotero and give participants a chance to start using it to build a library of references.</em></p>
