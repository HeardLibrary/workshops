##What is a Podcast?
What makes a podcast a podcast? What's the difference between podcasts, broadcasts, and webcasts? Let's list some characteristics of podcasts.

##Podcasting at Vanderbilt

* What podcasts are being produced at Vanderbilt University - what purpose and audience?
* Support - [Center for Teaching Podcasting Guide](http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/guides-sub-pages/podcasting/)
* Example - [Center for Teaching Podcast](http://cft.vanderbilt.edu/blog/podcasts/)
* [DiscoverArchive Podcast collection](http://discoverarchive.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/143)- podcast collecting initiative mirrored the iTunesU collection; needs to be relaunched to collect current and ongoing podcasts at the University.

##Audacity
Let's take a look at Audacity. I have created some example files for us to work with. (To use the examples, click the name of the file in the GitHub folder 'Examples"; then right click the Raw button and choose 'save link as'. Then you can open the saved file in your local copy of Audacity.) All the examples feature a dry signal from the mic. No added effects or editing have been applied to the audio.

* Open this file in Audacity: [EdwargaPodcastIntroOutro.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhueTdzQmlmMEItb2s/view?usp=sharing)
* Save as an Audacity project (.aup). 
* Close the project and open it again. 
* Export the audio to MP3.

##Activites
1. Listen to the five mic test files ([iPhone](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuLUdXVUJlQ2pXd00/view?usp=sharing), [Internal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhubzFSR1BGR3VQWEU/view?usp=sharing), [HeadSet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuMXhFa0Q5d1MwRkU/view?usp=sharing), [Dynamic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuTExhcFpYRkxtSm8/view?usp=sharing), [Yeti](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuXzh3MndYQjVrNW8/view?usp=sharing)). Which one sounds best?

4. Edit this file: Remove some of the silence between the audio in [DynamicMic.mp3](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuTExhcFpYRkxtSm8/view?usp=sharing)

2. Try [this editing recipe](http://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/2014/05/02/how-to-get-the-best-sounding-audio-for-your-podcast) on EdwargaPodcastIntroOutro. Open the project you created during the demo and start editing!

3. Add music to EdwargaPodcastIntroOutro. [Here's a track](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5qrNoxFaFhuUHZzRXJCUUwtWms/view?usp=sharing) by [Alistair Christie](https://soundcloud.com/alistairchristie) from SoundCloud with a [CC license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/). *Hint: Open the IntroOutro project and Import the music track (File-->Import-->Audio).*

5. Record a test track of your own. Try recording a short introduction to your own podcast. Record the audio, apply the [editing recipe](http://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/2014/05/02/how-to-get-the-best-sounding-audio-for-your-podcast), add some music, and export the track as an MP3. Use the notes as guide.
