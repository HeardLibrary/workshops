# Building and Online Presence

How do you establish a scholarly presence on the web? Should you use commercial services like Academia.edu or roll your own website with Wordpress or Jekyll? We’ll talk about the pros and cons of hosting your own scholarly documents, data, and domain.

## Learning Outcomes

* Be able to describe what an online presence is.
* Learn how to manage your online presence.
* Discover tools that assist in creating and maintaining an online presence.


## What constitutes your online presence? Why should you care?

An online presence is any existence of yourself that can be found via an online search. You might wish to remain completely anonymous but these days, if you are a member of an association or organization you might still show up online. Taking control of your online presence will help control your identity, increase visibility,and assist in getting jobs. It will mean that you can be found by name or you can be found by your research and subject specialty. You can share with others and get feedback on your work. Your online presence helps you develop relationships and credibility

## Stategies to improve online presence


#### Google Yourself
So what should you do to make sure your online presence is consistent with the way in which you want others to see you? The first thing you might do is Google yourself. Write down the first 10 hits you find and see if those are the 10 references to yourself that you would most want an internet searcher to see.

#### Build a webpage

One of the best ways to control your online presence is to build a webpage. There are several ways you can go about doing this. The first is to:

##### Pay for it

There are many services that allow you to set up a robust web site for yourself. These can include blogs or just links to important aspects of your web presence such as CVs or resumes, photos, research data, articles etc...
#### Squarespace


#### Host your own Wordpress instance

##### Build it for free

#### Github Pages

##### Wordpress at Vanderbilt

##### Freeish

#### ScienceSites

### Get your own domain name

### Develop content 
audio, podcasts, video, you tube Vimeo

#### Social Media
The Social Media that is most relevant to you somewhat depends on your discipline. Find out who the important voices are in your field and where they are communicating with each other.  Most disciplines at least use Twitter to stay connected as a form of "micro-blogging". Twitter is great for getting immediate answers to research questions, sharing references, research and pointers, and interfacing with the media.


#### Academia.edu "A platform for academics to share research papers. The company's mission is to accelerate the world's research."

#### ResearchGate "Our mission is to connect researchers and make it easy for them to share and access scientific output, knowledge, and expertise."

Academia.edu and ResearchGate do similar things and again, depending on your discipline have more or less accessiblity and credibility. These social media type sites have yet to mature but are often good ways to make your research available online. There is a lot of complexity involved in publishing rights, open access and peer review so these tools need to be used with awareness of the issues. For more on this subject see:

### Publishing

Your published research is obviously an important part of your online presence. Thinking through decisions about how and where to publish is beyond the scope of this workshop but I'll leave you with one word, Open Access.

### Tips for Maintaining a good online presence

* Set up a Google Alert
* Keep it curated, current, and consistent.
* Manage your privacy settings.
* Be constructive and collaborative.
* Plan how you will use different sites or whether you will use one at all.
* Don’t overcommit.
* Don’t do it because you think you have to.
* Be careful about what you share (data, unpublished results, proprietary information or anything embarrassing).
