# Web Annotations

## Learning Objectives
* Explore the concepts of Web Annotations and practice their application through the use of Hypothes.is Web Annotation tool. 
* Develop use cases for this technology.
* Evaluate examples of this technology.

## Introduction

Do you make notes in the margins of your books? Do you highlight important phrases and passages? Do you refer back to these notes later in your research and learning process? Have you ever wished you could do the same with web pages and PDFs?...

Web annotation tools provide the capability of filling in the margins of the web with notes and ideas. These notes can go social with the use of groups, or stay private for your own use. With applications for research and learning, web annotations provide a way to create and share a running commentary on the World Wide Web.

A web annotation is an online annotation associated with a web resource. With a web annotation system, a user can add, modify or remove information from a web resource without modifying the resource itself. The annotations can be thought of as a layer on top of the existing resource, and this annotation layer is usually visible to other users who share the same annotation system ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_annotation)). 

Now let's  explore the concept of web annotation and discuss its use in research and learning.

### Note
This presentation uses [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/groups/JEQoYxZJ/web-annotations-workshop) to explain and demonstrate web annotation tools. Participants are encouraged to use the Hypothes.is tool as a way to engage with the presentation content and to practice with a new technology.

* Please download and enable the [Hypothes.is extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hypothesis-web-pdf-annota/bjfhmglciegochdpefhhlphglcehbmek), 
* Create a user profile with the service.
* Now you can annotate this page and other pages mentioned in this post. start posting annotations to the public group.


## What Are Web Annotations?
Web annotations extend a graph of relationships binding each annotation to other annotations and to the Internet resources they reference.

The [Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/) provides definition along with drafts of specifications to use when implementing annotation functionality in your website or application. [Annotations](https://hypothes.is/a/AVJCyczf8sFu_DXLVd0N) are typically used to convey information about a resource or associations between resources. Simple examples include a comment or tag on a single web page or image, or a blog post about a news article.

### History
Early visions of the web included annotations ([Todd A Carpenter](http://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2013/04/30/iannotate-whatever-happened-to-the-web-as-an-annotation-system/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex)). The Memex machine envisioned by Vannevar Bush was a prototype hypertext machine and included functionality for producing and recalling personal annotations. Tim Berners Lee included annotations in the early models of the web, and they were [almost](https://hypothes.is/a/AVJC6HpH8sFu_DXLVd11) part of the early web browser [Mosaic's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)) design. 

[Marc Andreessen](http://genius.com/MarcAndreessen), one of Mosaic's developers, invested in [RapGenius](http://rap.genius.com/) early on. Now called [Genius](http://www.genius.com), the site offers much more than just annotated song lyrics. We will take a closer look later.


### How do web annotations work?

<image src="http://heardlibrary.github.io/workshops/MEDIA/annotation-architecture.svg"/>
This **[InfoGraphic!](https://www.w3.org/annotation/diagrams/annotation-architecture.svg)** models the architecture of web annotation systems.


The technical details of how web annotations work are laid out in the [The Web Annotation Data Model](https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/). This W3C working draft describes a framework for sharing annotations across platforms. It describes bodies, targets, annotations and specificResources as entities in the graph of relationships produced by web annotations. Feel free to read this document at the link above, and annotate it using your new Hypothes.is account.
 
## Use Cases for Web Annotations

### Pedagogy
Could web annotations be used for teaching and learning?

* [Collaborative Learning](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360131510000886)
* This post on the Chronicle of Higher Education's ProfHacker blog discusses using web annotation tools in the classroom: [How Do You Annotate in Your Class? by Lee Skallerup Bessette](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-do-you-annotate-in-your-class/60101)
* Annotation tools have dedicated education compnents to help apply these tools in teaching. See [#Education Genius](http://genius.com/static/education) and [Hypothes.is/Education](https://hypothes.is/education/)
* Conversation with Robin DeRosa about her experience teaching in the open using Hypothes.is.

 * https://googleguacamole.wordpress.com/2016/05/11/in-search-of-connected-learning-exploring-the-pedagogy-of-the-open-web/

### Open Research
There may be applications for annotations in opening the research process as transparent activities on the Web. 

* Scholarly Communications - [video @4:40](https://hypothes.is/annotating-all-knowledge/)
* [Sharing](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23124/abstract) annotations made during the research process
* Public Scholarship - [An astronomer discusses a poem about the sunset.](http://genius.com/789992)
* Commenting on published research
	* some impact metrics measure the amount of commentary around a published work.
* Could this lead to open peer review?
* Would you feel comfortable sharing your research annotations with a wide audience?

### What Else?
Add annotations to this passage with your own ideas for how this technology might be used.

## Examples
Now let's look at some other annotation tools. Perhaps you could implement some of these tools in your research or teaching. **Follow the links below and review a few tools. Annotate this page with your thoughts about these tools.**

### Genius.com
[Genius.com](http://genius.com) grew out of RapGenius a site where the user community analyzed song lyrics. It has grown into an impressive site which collects and annotates documents of all sorts.

(Code is available)[http://genius.com/web-annotator] to embed genius annotation functionality in your own website. Or you could use the genius.com interface to annotate documents on the site. [Support for educators](http://genius.com/static/education) is available for using genius.com with students. A [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genius/) plugin is also available.

One corpus of note is the collection of President Obama's [State of the Union](http://genius.com/a/the-white-house-annotates-with-genius) addresses annotated by White House staff.

### Hypothes.is
[Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is/about/) is a non-profit, open source project supported by the Knight, Mellon, Shuttleworth, Sloan and Helmsley Foundations. It is built on the open source [Annotator](http://annotatorjs.org/) project. [Support for educators](https://hypothes.is/education/) is available. A [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hypothesis/) plugin is also available.

[Ed Warga](https://hypothes.is/stream?q=user:acct:EdWarga@hypothes.is) uses Hypothes.is! You can participate too by creating a user account and installing the Chrome extension or bookmarklet.

### Annotator
For the developers, [Annotator](http://annotatorjs.org/) provides open source software and plugins.

### Lacuna Stories
[Lacuna Stories](http://www.lacunastories.com/) is a university classroom tool.

### Annotation Studio
[Annotation Studio](http://www.annotationstudio.org/) is currently under development at MIT.

### More Tools
[The Web Annotations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_annotation) Wikipedia article includes a list of annotation tools and their features.

### Goes well with
* PERMA - save a view of a webpage as it is when you annotate.
* Internet Archive - see older versions of websites using the Wayback Machine.
* Zotero - keep a list of documents you or your group are annotating.
