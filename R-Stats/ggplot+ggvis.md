#Making Interactive Graphs with R

##Goals

R is an open source programming language for statistical analysis. In this session, weâ€™ll show you how to get started with creating graphs in R. In particular, we'll demonstrate how to use two popular alternative to the base graphics utilities in R: [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org/) and [ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/). We'll talk about how these packages compliment each other as well as how they differ conceptually.

### Prerequisites

* Download the [R Programming Language](http://www.r-project.org/) in the version appropriate to your computer.
* Download the desktop version of [R Studio](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
* Install the required packages (the code below is for our workshop laptops)

```R
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)

install.packages("RCurl")
library(RCurl)

install.packages("dplyr")
library(dplyr)

install.packages("ggvis")
library(ggvis)

install.packages("scales")
library(scales)

install.packages("readxl")
library(readxl)

install.packages("babynames")
library(babynames)
```

### Why R?

* R is open source, meaning that you can get started today without any upfront costs
* R is widely-used both here at Vanderbilt and globally for data analysis
* R has [a package (usually multiple packages!)](http://cran.r-project.org/) for nearly every kind of analysis
* Using R fosters [reproducible research](http://christophergandrud.github.io/RepResR-RStudio/index.html)

### R is a *Programming* Language

* R is a programming language, not a 'point-and-click' statistical application 
* RStudio provides a integrated development environment (IDE) for R, making its appearance more user-friendly 
* People use R in lots of different ways
  * from evaluating simple statistical functions in a [REPL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
  * to developing interactive web applications with [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/)
* The combination of R & RStudio makes it possible to become production by learning a few functions and then develop expertise over time as necessary
  
## R Exercises

### [Average Heights and Weights for American Women](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/women.html)

We'll begin our explorations by rendering a simple graph with base graphics, ggplot2, and ggvis. This practice dataset of the average heights and weights for American women (ages 30-39) comes built in with the R programming language. Let's load the dataset into R and then explore it a little.

```R
# Assign the dataset to a variable
averages <- women

# explore the dataset
head(averages)
str(averages)
View(averages)
```

Now let's examine what how to make a scatter plot with this date using the built-in graphics package in R.

```R
attach(averages)
plot(weight, height, main="Average Heights and Weights of American Women", xlab="Weight", ylab="Height", pch=1)
```

We can also add a regression line to our plot by calling the `lines` function.

```R
lines(lowess(weight,height), col="blue")
```

The ggplot package allows us to produce the same graph, but provides a more consistent way to provide the data.

```R
# load ggplot 
library(ggplot2)

# plot the dataset
ggplot(averages, aes(x=weight, y=height)) + geom_point()

# plot the dataset with a trend line (linear regression)
ggplot(averages, aes(x=height, y=weight)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method = "lm")
```

Finally, here's the same plot with regression line using the ggvis package.

```R
# load ggvis and dplyr
library(ggvis)
library(dplyr)

# plot the dataset
averages %>%
  ggvis(~weight, ~height) %>% 
  layer_points() %>%
  layer_smooths()
```

N.B. If you receive an error `Error: unexpected SPECIAL in "%>%"`, it's probably caused by the way you cut and pasted this tutorial code. Try removing line breaks after the `%>%` and things should work fine.

You may reasonably ask, why are there essentially three different ways of producing the same scatter plot? We'll answer that question as we move forward with our examples.

### ggivs for data exploration

An advantage of ggvis over ggplot is that it allows you to create interactive tools for exploratory data analysis. We'll try this technique out with the `mtcars` dataset that comes packaged with `ggpot2`.

```R
# Load libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(ggvis)

# Create an interactive exploratory tool for the dataset
# See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24840804/is-it-possible-with-ggvis-to-interactively-change-the-variables-for-the-x-and-y

mtcars 
  %>% ggvis(~mpg, input_select(names(mtcars), map = as.name)) 
  %>% layer_lines()
```

But watch out when using this technique because certain kinds of plots won't make sense. You may want to control the options by creating a vector of column names in advance to avoid potential plotting problems.

### [ARL Library Investment Index](http://www.arlstatistics.org/analytics)

This dataset from the Association for Research Libraries (ARL) contains key information about academic library budgets and staffing. An Excel (XLS) file is available [here](http://www.arlstatistics.org/documents/ARLStats/index15.xls). Please download the file and save it somewhere accessible on your system.

```R
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(readxl)
library(scales)

# Load dataset from the Excel file
arl <- read_excel(file.choose(), sheet="e15", skip=1)

# Explore dataset
head(arl)
str(arl)
View(arl)

# Remove columns we do not want for our analysis
arl <- arl[,-c(1,2,3,9,10,11,12,13,14)]
View(arl)

# Remove row of extraneous data
arl <- arl[-115,]
View(arl)

# Changes names of columns for easier access 
names(arl)[c(1:5)] <- c("Institution", "Total", "Salaries", "Material", "Staff")
View(arl)

# Create a simple scatter plot
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Total)) + geom_point()

# Create a simple scatter plot (with trend line)
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Total)) + geom_point()
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Total)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm")

# Make the Y axes less cluttered
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Total)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma)

# Add title
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Total)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + ggtitle("ARL Staff versus Total Expenditures")
```

Of course, we're really interested to see where Vanderbilt appears on this trend line. Let's add another layer to our plot to highlight Vanderbilt in red.

```R
# Highlight Vanderbilt on the plot
# Thanks to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14351608/color-one-point-and-add-an-annotation-in-ggplot2/14351684#14351684

# First, create a subset of the data with only vanderbilt
Vandy <- subset(arl, Institution == "VANDERBILT")
View(Vandy)

# Then, create a scatter plot with a highlighted point for Vanderbilt
ggplot(arl, aes(x=Staff, y=Total)) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method="lm") + scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) + ggtitle("ARL Staff versus Total Expenditures") + xlab("Staff") + ylab("Total Expenditures") + geom_point(data=Vandy, colour="red")

```

Wouldn't it be nice as a next step to mark out points interactively? Here's where ggvis comes to the fore. We can use ggivs to set up an identical version of our graph with a dropdown box to select the library we'd like to highlight. 

```R
# Load the required libraries
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)
library(scales)

# Data available at http://www.arlstatistics.org/documents/ARLStats/index15.xls
arl <- read_excel(file.choose(), sheet="e15", skip=1)

# Remove the unnecessary data columns and rows
arl <- arl[,-c(1,2,3,9,10,11,12,13,14)]
arl <- arl[-115,]

# Add names to the colums
names(arl)[c(1:5)] <- c("Institution", "Total", "Salaries", "Material", "Staff")

# Create a list of institution names in alphabetical order for the dropdown list
institutions <- as.vector(unique(arl$Institution))

# Create an interactive graph of ARL staffing versus expenditures 
# with the ability to dynamically highlight member institutions.
arl %>%
    ggvis(~Staff, ~Total) %>% 
    layer_points() %>%
    layer_model_predictions(model = "lm", se = TRUE) %>%
    # Thanks to Hadley Wickham for this filter technique (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggvis/AJZCdjFcNaE)
    filter(Institution %in% eval(input_select(institutions, selected = 1))) %>%
    layer_points(fill := "red") 
```

### Baby Names

As a concluding exercise, let's make an interactive application to look at the popularity of particular baby names over the years. We'll draw on a [dataset of names given to at least five babies in any given year](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/babynames/index.html). We'll then create a visualization that allows us to switch between different names to chart their popularity.

```R
# Load the required libraries
library(babynames)
library(dplyr)
library(ggvis)

# Create a dplyr table because the dataset is so enormous
babynames <- tbl_df(babynames)

# Create a vector of all the unique names in the dataset, sorted alphabetically
names <- as.vector(unique(babynames$name))

# Take a sample of the most popular names for girls in the 1880's
sample_names <- sort(names[1:10])

# Generate an interactive plot wit the ability to select dynamically among baby names
babynames %>% 
    ggvis(~year, ~n) %>% 
    # Thanks to Hadley Wickham for this filter technique (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/ggvis/AJZCdjFcNaE)
    filter(name %in% eval(input_select(sample_names, selected = 1)), sex == "F") %>% 
    layer_smooths() %>%
    add_axis("x", title="Year",  format="####") %>%
    add_axis("y", title="Number", title_offset = 50)
```   

Why did we have to create a smaller vector to populate the dropdown list? Why not just add a dropdown with all the names? The problem is that there are 93,889 unique names, which are far too many to include in a dropdown menu. So we need to provide a smaller list. As an exercise, you might also make it possible for users to interactively switch between male and female births to see how different names fare across the sexes.

### Next Steps with R

If you're interested in learning more about ggplot, then definitely check out Winston Chang's [R Graphics Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/R-Graphics-Cookbook-Winston-Chang/dp/1449316956). There aren't as many materials about ggvis, which continues to develop rapidly, but you may want to consider the premium course on [Data Visualization in R with ggvis](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorial) at DataCamp.

The next step from ggvis is probably [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), RStudio's platform for deploying interactive graphics on the web. There is a [RStudio tutorial](http://ggvis.rstudio.com/interactivity.html) for adding ggvis plots to Shiny apps. We also have a workshop we teach [@VandyLibraries](https://twitter.com/vandylibraries) on [building Shiny apps](https://github.com/HeardLibrary/workshops/blob/master/R-Stats/shiny.md).
