#Wikipedia

##Purveyor of public knowledge
###Wikipedia is full of information! 
Wikipedia is a first stop for many when seeking new information or trying to learn about something. Students and academics can add to this public store by creating new content and adding to existing content. 

###Wikipedia is only as authoritative as you make it
####Crowdsourcing
Encyclopedias aim at three states - current, comprehensive, and authoritative. [This article](http://qz.com/480741/this-free-online-encyclopedia-has-achieved-what-wikipedia-can-only-dream-of/) suggests that the Wikipedia model - crowdsourcing - might only attain currency.

|  State | Attainment |
|---|---|
| Authoritative | X |
| Comprehensive | X |
| Up-to-date | √ |

####Contribute to Wikipedia
You can [contribute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Contributing_to_Wikipedia) to the authority and comprehensivness of Wikipedia by doing research and citing authoritative sources. If you and your colleagues concentrate on a particular section of Wikipedia, perhaps that portion of the encyclopedia can attain currency, comprensiveness, and authority. Or you could join a [project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Directory), and pick up the work!

### Wikipedia at Vanderbilt
The Wikipedia community encourages faculty to engage students with Wikipedia in their coursework. The best way for a faculty member to get started is to take the [Training for Educators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_educators). There is also a parallel [training program for students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_students). 

The Vanderbilt Library has a presence on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/VU). We hold workshops, trainings, and [edit-a-thons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_run_an_edit-a-thon). We also have [campus ambassadors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Training/For_Ambassadors) [Cliff Anderson](mailto:clifford.anderson@vanderbilt.edu) and [Ed Warga](mailto:ed.warga@vanderbilt.edu) in place to consult with faculty members thinking about setting up Wikipedia [Course Pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Course_pages) for their classes. You can find examples of course pages at other [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Institutions) with educational outreach programs.


##OK. But how do I use it?

Wikiedia itself contains all the information you need to [get started](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Getting_started). Tutorials, introductions, trainings, and other resources are all available. This blog post is adapted from the [sample workshop posted in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Workshop/Sample_one-day_workshop).

Your [Wikipedia Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Adventure) starts now!

###Principles and policies of Wikipedia

* There are [Five Pillars of Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Five_pillars) of Wikipedia.

* Wikipedia describes itself by stating [what Wikipedia is not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Wikipedia_is_not). For instance it is not a dictionary - articles with only definitions should be expanded with additional encyclopedic content.

* The Wikipedia [core content policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Core_content_policies) are:

	* [Neutral point of view](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view)

	* [Verifiablity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiablity)

	* [No original research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research)

###Navigating Wikipedia
####The side bar
Navigate to [a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation) and review the side bar. In the left column of every page there is a hefty set of links. Click on each link, or at least the ones you do not understand, to learn how to navigate Wikipedia.

####Article and project pages

Every article or project page has the following tabs on top:

* Article -or- Project Page
* Talk
* Read
* Edit
* View History

Return to [that Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navigation) and explore the tabs there.

####Talk pages
Article and project talk pages are a place to discuss edits being made to a page. Every talk page has the tabs:

* Read
* Edit
* New Section
* View History

####User Page
Registered users have a "personal portlet block" on the top right of every page that includes: 

* UserName
* My talk
* My sandbox
* My preferences
* My watchlist
* My contributions
* Log out

> [This page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Navigation) provides details of navigation in Wikipedia.

###Editing

You can practice editing Wikipedia in the [Wikipedia:Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox).

Or better yet, you can create an account and practice editing in your own sandbox.

####Create an account
Before you do any editing, you might consider starting an [account](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&returnto=Wikipedia%3AUsername+policy&type=signup) and choosing a [user name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Username_policy#Guidance_for_new_users).


####Practice editing
Now let's practice editing in the Sandbox.

    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:[NAME]/sandbox

 Find your sandbox. 
 * If not registered, go to [Wikipedia:Sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sandbox). 
 * If registered, create one at the "New Section" tab on your talk page.

* Navigate to [the sample exercises on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/VU/Events/fall2015_workshop#Workshop_Exercises).
	* Choose an exercise from the list. 
	* Click the edit link next to its section header. 
	* Copy the code there to your sandbox. 
* Edit away in your sandbox!
* Here's the [cheat sheet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Cheatsheet).

###Linking in Wikipedia
There are four types of links, explained in detail in [this tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Wikipedia_links). 

1. Wikilinks that link from a word or phrase in an article to another article.
1. Category links that some times appear in articles or talk pages, but usually are at the bottom of an article to put the article in a category listing.
1. InterWikimedia links that create short links between different projects, like Wikipedia and Wikitionary. 
1. External links to websites outside of Wikipedia. 

>The [citing sources tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial/Citing_sources) shows how to make external links which are both for citing sources and any external links section of an article. 

###Collaboration with other editors
Here's a look at what's expected of a Wikipedian. Don't be scared. The Wikipedia community is welcoming and wants to help you become a productive editor.

* [Assume Good Faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Assume_Good_Faith) - assumption that editors' edits and comments are made in good faith, even if the views look slanted or erroneous.
* [Consensus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Consensus) means that editors on an article use the [Talk page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page) to try to reach agreement on structure, content, references, balance of ideas, etc. in an article. If one disagrees with how other editors on the articles are editing, one can seek opinions and consensus from the broader community through a variety of [Noticeboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Noticeboards).
* Review Wikipedia's [BOLD, revert, discuss cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:BOLD,_revert,_discuss_cycle). Review [Revert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Revert). Note that it is considered [edit warring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Edit_warring) when one does not follow these policies.
* [Civility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility) means no personal attacks, harassment, legal threats, etc. And no [vandalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism), be it out of anger and frustration or just for fun. Editors can be blocked from editing for short or long periods of time for bad behavior.
* [Dispute resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution) is an important page to visit for guidance whenever you have a dispute. It lists the best sources for advice, asking for assistance or other opinions, and reporting behavior that clearly violates policies.
* [Noticeboards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Noticeboards) are used to seek advice about issues and resolve conflicts, or to deal with problematic behavior by other editors.
* [Wikipedia Wikiprojects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:WikiProjects) allow you to work with editors worldwide on articles of common interest, seek advice and solve problems. There are Wikiprojects covering the broadest issues: science, humanities, arts, etc.; and ones covering narrow issues: specific animal species, individual countries, music genres, etc. However, avoid [canvassing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvassing), which is asking a number of individual editors, especially those who have never edited the article in question, to support you on an issue.

##Some useful links for self-teaching

* [Annotated article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Annotated_article) which shows you many of the main features of an article such as the lead, table of contents, section headers, images, external links, etc.

* [Tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial) on html editing and formatting, linking, citing sources, using talk pages, etc. For future study, see [How to edit a page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:How_to_edit_a_page) and [Manual of Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style). For information about Wiki markup, see [Help:Wiki_markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup).

* Check out the [Editing talk pages exercise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop/Sample_exercises#Editing_talk_pages).

* Note that there are special rules to study for [Biographies of living persons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biographies_of_living_persons) and [Article titles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_titles).

##More training opportunities
* Learning by doing will be your primary method of learning to edit Wikipedia. Think of it as a [Wikipedia Adventure!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wikipedia_Adventure)
* Explore various other outreach and training modules as linked from [workshop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workshop) training resources section.
* Join an active [Wikipedia Wikiproject](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:WikiProjects) to work with others on articles of interest.
* Find any local Wikipedia Meetup at [Meetup/Nashville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meetup/Nashville).
* Organize your own "self-help" workshop with others who are interested in editing Wikipedia. 
* As editors become more experienced, have an "edit-a-thon" where editors edit articles of their choosing or all edit articles on a specific topic or improve one article together. (See [Collaborations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Collaborations).)
